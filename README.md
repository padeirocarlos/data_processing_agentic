Demonstrating the Reflection Design Pattern for Dynamic Data Processing via Agent-Based Architecture

# Reflection Design Pattern in Agent-Based Data Processing

This repository demonstrates how to apply the **Reflection Design Pattern** in a data processing context using an **agent-based architecture**. The goal is to enable dynamic method invocation and flexible behavior modification at runtime, promoting extensibility and reducing tight coupling between components.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Reflection Design Pattern**: Enables dynamic inspection and invocation of classes, methods, and fields at runtime.
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Each agent encapsulates specific processing logic and can be dynamically triggered based on runtime conditions.
- **Decoupled Processing**: Agents are not hardcoded, allowing for scalable and maintainable data workflows.

📈 Why Reflection Pattern?

    Traditional systems use static processing pipelines. Our reflective approach enables:

    Runtime Adaptation to unknown data types
    Continuous Improvement through learned preferences
    Reduced Configuration through intelligent auto-discovery
    Enhanced Maintainability with clear separation of concerns

## 📁 Project Structure

Description of Flowchart:

    Data → processed by Agent
    Agent → invokes Reflection Invoker
    Reflection Invoker → dynamically selects and calls Processing Logic
    Processing Logic → returns results back to the agent for further steps.

🛠️ Technology Stack

    Python 3.8+ with advanced metaprogramming
